Analysis of the problem

Alpine Inc. has been facing significant challenges because of their reliance on a manual deployment process. 
This approach has led to multiple missed releases, increased bugs within production, and a strain on both customer support and the development teams morale. 
The manual process is heavily dependent on one developer which is unsustainable. This manual process has also led to a critical release being missed for one of their largest clients. 
If not addressed these issues could lead to substantial financial loses. 


Explanation and justification of the solution

Using the CI pipeline automates the entire process from code commit to deployment. 
By using the CI pipeline Alpine Inc will avoid having the current issues its facing. 
The CI pipeline will ensure that code changes are automatically tested, validated, and deployed. 
The pipeline has multiple stages which collectively reduce the risk of human error and improve reliability of their releases. 
The stages include linting, unit testing, code coverage and end to end testing. 
In automating this process instead of their current manual process will ensure that only thoroughly tested and validated code will reach production, which will greatly improve the overall development workflow.
